# Data Structures and Algorithms

This repo contains some of my explorations into data structures and algorithms (DSA).

## Why?

Too often, it's easy to dismiss "the basics" as something that only noobs need to worry about. However, if that were the case:<br>
-  Why do accomplished musicians practice scales daily?<br>
-  Why do martial artists continue to practice basic forms their entire life?

Mastering a subject is not a purely linear progression. Instead, obtaining even a base level of competence requires looping back to review previously studied and practiced material, each time refining the understanding (mental model) and refining the ability to apply what is learned.

Competency in DSA is necessary for a software developer to write effective and efficient code. Additionally, a base-level understanding of DSA will be required to pass coding interviews at most companies. If only one of these were true, it'd be worth spending time reviewing DSA over the course of a software development career. Much more so given both are true.

## Repo Directories

Following are links to the main directories in the repo and a brief description of each. The directories are listed in reverse chronological order (based on date created).

-   [algorithms1](/algorithms1/) - [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) by Princeton University and taught by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick.
-   [firehose](/firehose/) - DSA explorations from the Firehose Project web development bootcamp.
-   [leetcode](/leetcode/) - Solutions to LeetCode problems.
