# Algorithms, Part I

by Princeton University

## Course Information

The course [Algorithms, Part I](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithms-part1) by Princeton University and taught by Kevin Wayne and Robert Sedgewick can be found for free on [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). The course covers the essentials of algorithms and data structures, with emphasis on applications and scientific performance analysis.

## Python

While Java is the programming language used in the course, I will use Python. The simplicity of Python's syntax allows for more focus to be placed on the concepts being learned rather than the specifics of the language. For similar reasons, Python is an ideal language to use in coding interviews. All the more reason to use Python.

## Course Material

### Week 1

-   [Union-Find](./week1_1_union_find/) - Introduction to the basic approach to developing and analyzing algorithms, the union−find data type, and consideration of several implementations (quick find, quick union, weighted quick union, and weighted quick union with path compression). Application of the union−find data type to the percolation problem from physical chemistry.
